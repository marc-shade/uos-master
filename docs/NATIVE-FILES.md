# Native owned IEC files and directories — ABI 1.2

Native applications can open, read, exclusively create, write and close SEQ,
PRG and USR files through the kernel. Two streams can be open at once, on the
same or different IEC devices. Each handle belongs to an owner and includes a
generation, so a released handle cannot select a later file. Application exit
closes its native files before releasing its executable and banked memory.
ABI 1.3 extends these same entries with an owned [Ultimate backend](NATIVE-ULTIMATE.md).
ABI 1.4 also routes the [application loader](NATIVE-APPS.md) through these streams.
ABI 1.5 adds [owned Ultimate directory cursors](NATIVE-ULTIMATE.md#directory-cursors--abi-15)
through OPEN/READ/CLOSE with format 3 and mode 2; N_DIRPAGE remains IEC-only.
The IEC-specific geometry, names, channels and quarantine rules below still apply to IEC.

The calculator is the first product client: **S** exports up to 32 history
results, oldest first, to a named SEQ file on the application's source disk. Each line
ends with CR. It closes, reopens and compares every byte before reporting
`HISTORY SAVED AND VERIFIED`. An existing name is rejected without replacement.
An I/O error can leave a partial new file; the calculator reports that outcome.
**Esc** cancels the filename prompt. This export does not automatically reload
history into a later calculator session.

The [native browser](NATIVE-BROWSER.md) uses directory pages to list files,
discover applications and inspect byte streams. This is a foreground IEC backend.
The [shared file picker](NATIVE-FILE-DIALOGS.md) and [graphical suite Files app](NATIVE-FILES-GUI.md)
use these owned services. Seek/append/replacement, REL and GEOS/VLIR formats,
removable-media identity and the driver registry remain open. The older C64-mode
desktop retains separate legacy APIs during migration.

## Calls and mailbox

Include [`api.inc`](../src/native/api.inc) and declare required ABI minor **1**
for streams or **2** for directory pages in the application manifest.
The current ABI 1.14 kernel accepts required minors 0 through 14.
Use the active `N_CURRENT` owner for file and memory allocations. File arguments
use their own mailbox; `N_FOWNER` is independent of the heap's `N_OWNER`.

| Entry | Address | Operation |

| Field | Address | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| N_FOWNER | `$3d80` | Owner 1..254 |
| N_FHANDLE | `$3d81..84` | Slot+1 followed by a little-endian 24-bit generation |
| N_FDEVICE | `$3d85` | IEC device 8..30 |

The shared `N_BUFFER` is `$3a00..$3bff`. OPEN uses it as metadata scratch;
prepare write bytes after OPEN succeeds. Heap transfers also use this buffer.
Save handles in application-owned memory when alternating streams. PRG reads
include their stored load-address bytes; the file service never executes them.

Names contain printable bytes `$20..$7e` and exclude `* ? , : / \ @ # $`.
The service adds an explicit type and access suffix. Directory, direct-buffer,
replacement and path syntax are unavailable through an ordinary filename.
Disk images with damaged, open/splat or unsupported file records are rejected.

All calls require the standard native MMU `$0e`, common RAM, zero-page and stack
configuration, interrupts enabled and normal keyboard/screen default channels.
They return A=0/carry clear on success; errors return A=code/carry set. Decimal
and interrupt flags, KERNAL filename/device/bank parameters and message flags
are preserved. A/X/Y and other flags are scratch. Nested file/heap calls are
rejected before changing the active operation's result or lock.

Errors retain the native hexadecimal values: `01` bad argument, `03` no slot, `04` stale or
invalid handle, `05` wrong owner, `06` invalid count/position overflow, `07`
reentry, `08` platform, `09` corrupt descriptor/disk metadata, `11` IEC/DOS
failure and `15` channel conflict. DOS 62 means absent file, and 63 means an
exclusive create found an existing file.

## Directory pages

Set N_FOWNER, N_FDEVICE, N_FFORMAT and N_DPAGE, then call N_DIRPAGE. Start
with page 0 and continue using N_DNEXT until it is `$ff`. A successful page
contains eight 32-byte records in N_BUFFER, including deleted slots:

| Record offset | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Type: 0 deleted, 1 SEQ, 2 PRG, 3 USR, 4 REL; other values backend-specific |
| 1 | Flags: `$80` closed, `$40` locked |
| 2..17 | Exact 16-byte PETSCII name padded with `$a0` |
| 18..19 | Allocated blocks, little-endian 16-bit |
| 20..31 | Reserved; do not interpret |

Copy a needed page before another file or heap transfer reuses N_BUFFER.
Deleted entries should be skipped. Names and type flags describe the disk;
they do not guarantee that the stream API can open that entry. An empty disk
normally returns eight deleted records. Requesting a page beyond the actual
directory but within the geometry's capacity returns count 0 and next `$ff`.

Each call rewalks from the root, bounded to 18 D64/D71 pages or 37 D81 pages.
Page ordinals and links are checked before publication. This bounds cyclic
directories but is not a complete early cycle detector. Sequentially reading
all 37 D81 pages can require 703 directory-sector reads; persistent cursors
and faster enumeration remain work.

The call selects mode 2, ignores filename/type arguments and
requires a free owned-file slot. Successful cleanup clears N_FHANDLE and
leaves no new stream open. Existing same-device owned streams retain their
shared command channel. Other-device streams remain intact. On uncertain
cleanup, the temporary mode-2 handle remains owned; N_FCLOSE/N_FRELEASE uses
the same retained-error rules as streams. Check carry before using page data
or claiming that resources were released.

## Length, EOF and error handling

Read OPEN follows the directory and file-sector links using read-only `U1`
commands through a temporary direct buffer. It validates geometry, bounds the
directory walk, checks the declared block count and computes the exact byte
extent from the final sector. Ordinary reads then stream through the KERNAL,
bounded by that extent. The operation issues no raw disk writes.

This check addresses an observed 1541 emulation behavior: a zero-byte file
returned 254 padding bytes through CHRIN, and a one-byte file returned four.
Independent sector inspection confirmed the shorter stored files; c1541
extracted the one-byte files correctly but also returned padding for the empty
file. Replacing CHRIN with ACPTR produced the same responses. Empty
reads therefore return EOF without issuing CHRIN. Only an independently
measured one-byte file may finish without EOI on its first byte. Larger files
require EOI at the exact end; early or missing EOI poisons the handle. No
contents are trimmed by matching a byte pattern.

After EOF, further reads return zero bytes without disk I/O. On a read failure,
N_FACTUAL describes bytes already copied into the buffer. On a write failure,
it describes bytes accepted by the KERNAL before the error; the final IEC byte
may still have been deferred, so this count is **not proof of persisted bytes**.
Close and reopen to compare content before promising a verified save.

Each transferred byte and output flush checks IEC status. DOS status is checked
at OPEN, CLOSE and metadata commands; it is not polled between data chunks.
Always check CLOSE: a successful WRITE means the KERNAL accepted the bytes, and
a drive error may be reported when closing. Repeated intermediate DOS-status
reads caused truncated responses with the tested 1571 emulation. Removing
those reads passed the complete D71 copy/readback test; adding a delay did not
resolve the failure. The underlying firmware/emulator timing cause is not yet
established.

A failed transfer cannot be replayed on its poisoned handle. CLOSE may release
that handle if closing and final status checks succeed. An uncertain close
retains its owner and error; subsequent CLOSE/RELEASE reports that error without
blindly repeating disk operations. If OPEN fails after uncertain cleanup, its
returned handle remains owned. A completely cleaned failed OPEN clears the
output handle. Check carry before using it: preflight rejection need not clear
a previous handle value.

Application cleanup stops on the first file error and retains the app owner,
code slot and banked data, with N_APPSTATE=4. This prevents a later app from
inheriting uncertain channels. There is no general recovery UI yet. Direct raw
KERNAL files remain the application's responsibility.

## Channel ownership and disk scope

Data LFNs are 122/123 with secondary addresses 8/9. Command LFNs 124/125 are
shared per device and remain open until that device's last native stream
closes. LFN 126/secondary 10 is used temporarily during read OPEN and DIRPAGE. The service
checks the complete KERNAL table before issuing I/O, preserves unrelated files
on other devices and rejects foreign files on the selected device. Closing
command channel 15 can close that device's other files, so it must be last.
The app loader uses one of these same two owned stream slots and closes it
before entering the app. A native stream owned by another caller can retain
the same-device command lease throughout loading. Foreign device files are
still rejected; the loader no longer has private LFNs 120/121.

The geometry selector is explicit, not device discovery. It covers standard
35-track D64, 70-track D71 and unpartitioned/root 80-track D81 layouts. It does
not qualify arbitrary IEC devices, firmware, partitions, enlarged D64 formats,
SD2IEC native directories or media changes during an open stream. More than
two streams, persistent directory cursors and media identity remain future work.

The read-only block commands and disk layouts follow the original Commodore
[1571 User's Guide, chapters 7 and appendix C](https://s3.amazonaws.com/com.c64os.resources/weblog/sd2iecdocumentation/manuals/1571_Users_Guide.pdf)
and [1581 User's Guide, chapter 6 and appendix C](https://s3.amazonaws.com/com.c64os.resources/weblog/sd2iecdocumentation/manuals/1581_Users_Guide.pdf).
The 1541 chain layout and DOS behavior are also described in
[Inside Commodore DOS](https://www.pagetable.com/docs/Inside%20Commodore%20DOS.pdf).

## Verification

```sh
python3 tests/ci_native_files.py --report /tmp/native-files.json
python3 tests/ci_native_directory.py --report /tmp/native-directory.json
python3 tests/ci_native_calc.py --report /tmp/native-calculator.json
python3 -u tests/run_ci.py nativefiles nativefiles71 nativefiles81 native
python3 -u hw_ultimate_check.py --native-files
```

The CPU tests require Py65. They execute assembled code against independent
file/sector models and inject transfer, status, channel and cleanup faults.
The emulator tests cold boot the native disk and load a test-only client, then
copy and reopen more than 64 KiB through real KERNAL/drive emulation. The physical
test uses smaller private D64 fixtures and retrieves their complete images
through the cartridge protocol after restoring the legacy desktop. An independent
host reader validates each file's sector chain and exact stored bytes, including
empty files. c1541 provides a second byte comparison for every nonempty file;
its empty-file padding is recorded separately.

See the [dated evidence and qualification limits](validation/2026-09-09-native-files/README.md)
for actual outcomes; a listed test command alone is not a passing result.
Directory and browser results are recorded in the
[ABI 1.2 checkpoint](validation/2026-09-09-native-browser/README.md).
