# Native Ultimate controls

Open **Ultimate** with U on the native desktop. The app is included as
`ULTIMATE` on both desktop suite disks and uses ABI 1.12. Both VIC and VDC show
the blue suite controls and shared 1351 pointer. A 64 KiB VDC uses yellow focus;
16 KiB uses reversed light controls. Unavailable graphics retain text controls.
The four pages show identification, drive inventory, configured network
addresses and a refreshable cartridge clock reading.

| Key | Page/action |
|---|---|
| I | Hardware and target identification |
| D | Drive types, IEC addresses and power flags |
| N | Network interface IP, mask and gateway |
| T | Cartridge RTC snapshot |
| Tab / Enter | Focus / activate a visible control |
| Left/right | Select target, drive or network interface |
| Up/down on Drives | Select a drive |
| M / E on Drives | Choose an image to mount / request eject |
| R | Refresh |
| Escape | Return to desktop |

The image picker shares the graphical surface on both displays, then returns
to the app's blue controls. It accepts an absolute Ultimate DOS path from either context. The
confirmation shows the destination IEC address and complete image path, with
**Cancel** initially selected. Tab chooses Confirm; Enter activates the selected
button. Escape cancels. Supported suffixes are D64, D71, D81, G64 and G71,
case insensitive. Names up to 255 bytes are retained and transmitted in full.
The text view normalizes ASCII case and substitutes dots for bytes its font
cannot show; the command retains the original name bytes.

Mount/eject requires a supported, powered drive with a valid, unambiguous IEC
address. The boot IEC address, the IEC app source and every slot observed with
either system address stay protected for this app session. An address duplicated
by an off drive is also ambiguous. Confirmation refreshes the inventory and
requires the displayed count, records and selection to agree exactly before
sending a command. A changed inventory requires a new choice and confirmation.
KERNAL/native open files and a foreign file in either DOS context prevent the
operation. The app never closes a foreign file to make the operation possible.

An accepted request is reported as **Request accepted**. This firmware's mount
and eject handlers do not propagate the subsystem operation result, so a `00`
reply cannot establish that the image mounted or ejected. Refresh checks the
drive inventory; it does not verify the mounted image. A failed or uncertain
operation is never replayed automatically.

Partial drive inventories are labeled as partial. The observed count=4,
length=7 form contains only two records; those A/B records require independent
power replies to agree before either can enable an operation. The remaining
peripheral records stay unknown. Invalid lengths, fields,
clock dates and failed requests replace the previous page's data with an
error. An unused identification target may return `NO TARGET`. Network
addresses describe configuration; they do not prove connectivity.

## Shared query service

`N_UQUERY = $1c6e` uses the same ownership checks, file lock, packet transport,
bounded timeout and owned-abort completion as native Ultimate file operations.
It refuses a foreign UCI transaction or a pending native directory packet.
It does not change files, paths, mounted images, configuration or the clock.

Set `N_FOWNER` to the active app owner, `N_UOP` at `$3d3c` to an operation below,
and `N_UARG` at `$3d3d` when needed. Call from the foreground with IRQs enabled.
On return, `N_FACTUAL` counts the response prefix in the 512-byte `N_BUFFER`.
`N_FERROR`, `N_FDOS`, `N_FSTATUS` and `N_USTATUS` retain the transport/target
result. A nonzero numeric target status is an I/O error. The application
validates the meaning and length of returned bytes before displaying them.

| Operation | Value | Argument | Wire command |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Identify | 0 | Target 1–15 | `target 01` |
| Hardware model | 1 | — | `04 28 00` |
| Effective drive inventory | 2 | — | `04 29 01` |
| Drive A power | 3 | — | `04 34` |
| Drive B power | 4 | — | `04 35` |
| Network interface count | 5 | — | `03 02` |
| Interface MAC | 6 | Index | `03 04 index` |
| Interface IP/mask/gateway | 7 | Index | `03 05 index` |
| RTC | 8 | — | `01 26` |

## Shared command service

`N_UCOMMAND = $1c71` accepts a target/command header in `N_BUFFER[0:2]` and
`N_FCOUNT` following body bytes, for a total of 2–512 bytes. `N_FCOUNT` is
**0–510**, not the total packet length. The service rejects overlong lengths
and 16-bit wrap before sending. It uses the query service's ownership,
IRQ, locking, foreign-transaction, pending-directory, reply and abort contract.
The reply replaces the request buffer. `N_FACTUAL` counts its retained prefix.
No automatic retry is performed.

The command service serializes packets; callers remain responsible for command
semantics and affected resources. The Ultimate app adds the drive policy above
and sends only FILE_INFO probes (`context 07`), mount
(`context 23 IEC full-path`) and eject (`context 24 IEC`). The fixed query API
remains read only and continues rejecting operation numbers 9–255.

The 56-byte command entry occupies existing reserved space after the query
service. Relocating the 25-byte keyboard-input wrapper into presentation padding
keeps the resident heap at 426 pages. The app occupies 96 pages and uses a
separate 36-page VIC surface. Its [graphical file picker](NATIVE-PICKER-GUI.md)
shares the display, font and pointer. The four-page picker scratch buffer is
allocated in bank 0 when opening the picker and freed after its cursors and
cache close. Allocation failure keeps the panel usable and permits a later retry.

Copy `VDSVC.PRG` beside the app. The [shared VDC service](NATIVE-VDC-SERVICE.md)
loads from the original app source and stays owned across picker transitions.
It saves one original screen until final app exit. REU backing leaves 264
main-RAM pages free; RAM backing leaves 200 with a 16 KiB VDC or 192 with 64 KiB.
Picker scratch and cache temporarily consume additional pages. Dirty rows and
pointer movement update incrementally. A failed VDC transfer freezes drive
actions; Escape retries restoration before any display, component or app owner
is released. A clean setup refusal permits VIC graphics and VDC text fallback. A failed
picker surface restores the VDC before using text controls; Refresh in the
main panel retries graphical VDC setup.

Source command definitions
were checked against Ultimate firmware revision
`a01c04e8267a0d916b7203cb34dcf1127f75981d` in `control_target`,
`network_target`, and `dos`; the drive type enum is in `c1541.h`.

## Qualification

`tests/ci_native_query.py` exercises literal command bytes, argument rejection,
packet lengths/statuses, ownership, IRQ/decimal state, timeouts and coexistence
with files/directories. `tests/ci_native_command.py` covers the generic packet
contract, including full 512-byte requests and overlong/wrapped lengths.
`tests/ci_native_drives.py` checks drive policy and literal mount/eject packets
against independent device state. `tests/ci_native_controls.py` retains full
console and invalid-response checks. `tests/ci_native_controls_gui.py` exercises
the graphical controls, full bitmap/text comparisons, picker, confirmations,
faults and input/display teardown.

`ci_native_vdc_controls.py` covers complete panel bitmaps and retained display
failure recovery on both VDC sizes. The picker, REU and fallback companion
tests cover complete dialog canvases, incremental fields/pointers, one explicit
mount, backing-store restoration, missing/corrupt components and picker memory
pressure. The VICE pointer workflow compares complete Ultimate VIC/VDC canvases
and checks the saved VRAM before app handoff.

The [frozen software record](validation/2026-09-13-native-ultimate-drives/README.md) retains the CPU,
full mouse/keyboard VICE, serial shutdown and rebuild evidence. No physical
drive operation has been attempted with these images. Native
physical qualification, settings changes, network services and broader device
management remain open. A physical suite run also requires a qualified
observer that reads Claude shutdown state before its allocation is released.

The [combined suite evidence](validation/2026-09-12-native-claude-suite/README.md)
retains the exact query/panel binaries and reports, together with the added
Claude app and five-entry desktop.
