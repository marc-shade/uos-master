; One-shot native C128 IRQ observer that holds the foreground (GPL v3).
; For apps whose idle loop keeps using N_BUFFER ($3a00), such as AES clients:
; the IRQ stays in this handler while the host saves $3a00, lets the copy run,
; reads the result and puts $3a00 back, so the foreground never sees the
; borrow. No heap or KERNAL calls except INDFET ($ff74) for RAM.
; $3ff0 old IRQ, +2 done (1 ok, 2 host timeout, 4 bad command, 5 busy),
; +3 mode (0 RAM, 1 VDC memory), +4 bank (0/1, RAM), +5 source word, +7 count
; word (1..512), output at $3a00. VDC mode runs only when the foreground is
; idle at its input wait (N_READY = 1), so no VDC register access of its own
; is interrupted; otherwise it returns 5 at once and the host tries again. It
; restores the VDC update address (registers 18/19) and leaves register 31
; selected, as the ROM editor does.
; +11/+12 MMU mode/common registers; +13 interrupted foreground MMU config.
; +14 handshake: probe 1 held; host 2 copy; probe (after the copy) waits for
; host 3 release. Each wait gives up after about 20 seconds.
